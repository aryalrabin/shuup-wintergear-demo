            **For optimal comfort without sacrificing performance, MT-7 ski boots
            offer stiff flex with a 2-part system: comfortable support boots to walk
            in that lock into a rigid open chassis when it's ski time.**

            * Made for advanced skiers, the rigid open chassis provides tunable
                flex suspension, cuff alignment and micro adjustable buckles that
                make them customizable to your ski stance

            * Chassis offers a direct connection to your skis and precise control
                thanks to rigid construction, and it's designed to work very well
                with modern ski shapes

            * Easy to walk around in and very warm, the support boots have a heat
                moldable liner and dual reels with 18 points of closure for precise
                fit

            * Boa system tightens gradually using a simple twisting knob and
                lacing cables to produce even snugness throughout boots

            * Custom-moldable liners offer a great fit right out of the box, but
                they can also be custom formed using a heat treatment

            * Front tongue handles for easy entry

            * For a proper fit, Aptix recommends ordering the same size as your
                street shoes; if you are between sizes, order up to the next size

            The Expert 79 is an incredibly versatile all-mountain ski for aspiring
            expert to advanced skiers. With the heart of a frontside carver and a
            freeride touch and feel, this powerful one-ski-quiver delivers enhanced
            performance for easier progression in all snow conditions. Traditional
            camber underfoot delivers powerful edge grip and confident stability.
            Experience more whether cruising through chop, weaving through trees, or
            carving on hardpack on this revolutionary new breed of high-performance
            all-mountain skis.

            ## Skis

            * Easy-to-turn honeycomb tip and tail are significantly lighter than
                previous models; you can actually see the light pass through the
                air-filled spaces in the honeycomb
            * You'll really appreciate the weight savings when the skis are
                strapped to your pack and you hike up the ridge to get first tracks
            * The responsive strength of the skis shines when dropping into steep
                terrain, negotiating a technical line, and straight-lining it back
                to the base
            * Float like a feather on top of deep snow thanks to the rockered tips
                and tails; redesigned rocker minimizes the tendency of tips to flap
                at high speeds
            * Standard camber underfoot offers tenacious edge-grip on hardpack;
                there's more than enough camber to enjoy carving on groomers
